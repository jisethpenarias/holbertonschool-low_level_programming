**0x18. C - Dynamic libraries**


0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
    Create the dynamic library libholberton.so.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
    Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
